				<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my small space on the internet. As you already know, I am a software engineer from Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬. I am someone who is really concerned about people and hence I enjoy solving problems that directly affect people the most. I really enjoy teaching and my most important career goal is to become a recognised expert in my field and offer mentorship to younger developers. I also really look forward to learning and working with web3 as well as augmented and virtual reality technologies. If you think my skills are a fit for a cool project you're working on please reach out, rest assured I'd love to work with you. Cheers ðŸ¥‚!</p>
